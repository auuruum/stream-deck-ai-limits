# Claude & Codex Usage — Stream Deck plugin

Show your **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **GitHub Copilot** usage limits right on your Elgato
Stream Deck keys.

Each key displays your quota percentage, color-coded by how close you are to the
limit, and updates automatically. The windows differ per provider: Claude and Codex have a rolling
**5-hour** and **weekly** quota, while Copilot instead has a single **monthly premium-interactions**
quota. No tokens to paste — the plugin reads the credentials the official CLIs already created when
you logged in.

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin reads usage from **unofficial / internal endpoints** used by the Claude Code, Codex,
> and GitHub Copilot CLIs. They are not public APIs and **may change or break** without notice.

## What it looks like

Four action types (drag any of them onto a key):

| Action | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Usage** | Claude's 5-hour and weekly usage in one key (two bars) |
| **Codex Usage** | Codex's 5-hour and weekly usage in one key (two bars) |
| **Copilot Usage** | Copilot's monthly **premium interactions** usage in one key (bar + days-left countdown) |
| **Usage (single window)** | One provider + one window, larger, with the reset date/time and/or countdown |

Color bands (configurable): `0–69%` green · `70–89%` yellow · `90–99%` orange · `100%` red.
These bands describe the original Used mode. Codex can also show quota Remaining, where lower
percentages indicate less available quota.

## Requirements

- **Elgato Stream Deck** app 6.5+ (Windows 10+ or macOS 12+).
- For Claude usage: **[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)** installed and logged in.
  On Windows and Linux that means `~/.claude/.credentials.json` must exist; on macOS, Claude Code
  stores its credentials in the login Keychain instead and the plugin reads them from there.
- For Codex usage: **[Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex)** installed and logged in with a
  ChatGPT account (`~/.codex/auth.json` must exist).
- For Copilot usage: **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)** installed and logged in
  (`gh auth login`). The token is read from `gh auth token` — optionally via a custom
  `hosts.yml`-style file — see [Copilot](#copilot).

You only need the CLI for the provider(s) you want to display.

## Installation

### From a release (recommended)

1. Download the latest `com.singerous.ai-limits.streamDeckPlugin` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/Sing3Rous/stream-deck-ai-limits/releases) page.
2. Double-click it — the Stream Deck app installs it.
3. Find the **Claude & Codex Usage** category in the actions list and drag an action onto a key.

### From source (development)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# link the plugin into the Stream Deck app and start it:
npx streamdeck link com.singerous.ai-limits.sdPlugin
npx streamdeck restart com.singerous.ai-limits
```

`npm run watch` rebuilds and restarts the plugin on change.

## Settings (Property Inspector)

Select a key to configure it:

- **Refresh interval** — how often to poll (60–600 s, default 120 s). The minimum is 60 s on
  purpose; see [Polling & rate limits](#polling--rate-limits).
- **Display mode** — Codex only, in both **Codex Usage** and **Usage (single window)** when
  Provider is Codex. Choose **Remaining** (`100 − used`, clamped to 0–100) or **Used**. The
  percentage and bar/gauge always show the same value; unknown usage stays unknown.
- **Warning / Critical thresholds** — the percentages at which a bar turns yellow / orange.
  Used triggers at or above the threshold; Remaining triggers at or below it. Critical takes
  priority, and exhausted quota (100% used / 0% remaining) is red.
- Refresh and threshold controls are **numeric fields with visible units** (`120 sec`, `20 %`,
  `10 %`). Type an exact whole number and press Enter or leave the field to save; Escape restores
  the saved value. Invalid values show a range error and do not overwrite your settings.
- **Credentials path** — optional override if your credentials file is in a non-standard location.
  Leave empty to use the default. Setting this opts out of the macOS Keychain lookup: an explicit
  path is taken at face value, so a missing file there is reported as an error.

The **single-window** action adds: **Provider** (Claude/Codex/Copilot), **Window** (5-hour / weekly,
plus Fable 7-day for Claude only; a Copilot key always shows its monthly quota and ignores this
setting),
**Reset info** (date-time / countdown / both / hidden), **Date format**, and **Provider accent**
(colored frame / tinted background / none).

### Copilot

The Copilot action shows your monthly **premium interactions** quota: a bar for how much of the
month you've used, plus a "**N days left**" countdown to the quota reset.

**This window is specific to Copilot — it has no equivalent for Claude or Codex.** Premium
interactions are the requests GitHub meters against your plan (the premium models and agent modes);
ordinary completions and base-model chat are unmetered and are not shown here. Unlike Claude's and
Codex's rolling 5-hour and weekly windows, this quota is a **calendar-month allowance tied to your
billing cycle**, which is why a Copilot key shows one bar rather than two, and why the single-window
action fixes its window to the session.

- **Endpoint** — this reads the **unofficial internal endpoint**
  `GET https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` (the same one the GitHub CLI's Copilot
  subcommands use). It is **not** a public API and may change or break without notice.
- **Token** — resolved in this order:
  1. a custom **credentials path** you set in the Property Inspector (a bare token, or a
     `hosts.yml`-style file with `github.com: → oauth_token:`);
  2. the GitHub CLI's own `hosts.yml` (`%APPDATA%\GitHub CLI\hosts.yml` on Windows,
     `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` elsewhere, or `$GH_CONFIG_DIR/hosts.yml` if set);
  3. `gh auth token` — the GitHub CLI must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- **Settings** — the Copilot PI has the same refresh interval (60–600 s, default 120 s), warning /
  critical thresholds (70 / 90), and an optional credentials-path override. Copilot always uses the
  **session** window; there is no weekly window, so the single-window action fixes the window
  dropdown to the session for Copilot.

Changes apply live — no need to restart the plugin.

New Codex Usage keys default to Remaining with warning **20%** / critical **10%**. Existing
configured keys without a display-mode setting keep Used and their existing thresholds. New
single-window keys remember Remaining for Codex while initially showing Claude as before;
choosing Codex converts the current thresholds (Claude's default 70/90 becomes 30/10 remaining).
Switching modes converts custom thresholds to preserve the same warning levels: Used 80/90
becomes Remaining 20/10 and converts back on the next switch. Switching the single-window
provider also preserves those levels; Claude and Copilot always display Used. An explicit
threshold edit sent together with a mode change is kept as entered.

The mode and thresholds are saved in the action's Stream Deck settings, so each key keeps its
choice across restarts, profile switches, and action reloads. Authentication, polling, API data,
and reset times are unchanged.

To build an installer using the project's Elgato CLI dependency:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run lint:tsc
npm run build
npx streamdeck pack com.singerous.ai-limits.sdPlugin --output dist --no-update-check
```

The installer is `dist/com.singerous.ai-limits.streamDeckPlugin`. Packaging validates the plugin
before creating it; see the [Elgato pack command](https://docs.elgato.com/streamdeck/cli/commands/pack/).

## Polling & rate limits

The usage endpoints are rate-limited. In particular, Claude's endpoint allows only a few requests
per 5-minute window and then returns `429` with a 5-minute back-off. The plugin therefore:

- defaults to polling every **120 s** and enforces a **60 s minimum**;
- **shares one request** only across keys with the same provider, refresh interval, resolved
  credentials path, and thresholds (matching keys don't multiply calls);
- **throttles key-press refreshes** (a press fetches at most once per 10 s; otherwise it just
  re-draws the cached value);
- on a `429`, **backs off** (honoring `Retry-After`) and keeps showing the last known numbers with a
  small "stale" dot instead of blanking the key.

Pressing a key forces an immediate refresh (subject to the throttle above).

---

## Security

- The plugin **reads local credentials** created by the official Claude Code / Codex login flows, or
  obtained from the GitHub CLI (`gh auth token`). It never asks you to paste a token.
- Tokens are kept **in memory only**. The plugin does **not** write them to Stream Deck settings, and
  does **not** modify your credentials files.
- Tokens and `Authorization` headers are **never logged**.
- Usage data is sent **only** to the provider's own usage endpoint — nowhere else. No telemetry.
- On macOS, Claude's Keychain item is read via the absolute path `/usr/bin/security`, so a binary
  of that name earlier in your `PATH` cannot intercept the call.
- **`gh` is resolved through `PATH`**, unlike the above. The GitHub CLI has no fixed install
  location (Homebrew, winget, scoop, nix and manual installs all differ), so pinning one path would
  break more setups than it protects. This is a deliberate trade-off: writing to a `PATH` directory
  already implies enough access to read the same token straight out of `hosts.yml`, so the
  substitution gains an attacker nothing they could not do more simply. If that trade-off doesn't
  suit your machine, set an explicit **Credentials path** in the Property Inspector — that skips
  the `gh` subprocess entirely.

## Troubleshooting

| Key shows | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Login Required** | Credentials file missing, or the session/token is invalid (401/403). | Log in with the CLI (`claude` / `codex` / `gh auth login`) and the key recovers on the next refresh. |
| **Rate Limited** | The endpoint returned `429`. | Wait — it recovers automatically. Avoid spamming the key; increase the refresh interval if it persists. |
| **Error** | Network error or an unexpected response. | Check your connection. If it persists, the unofficial endpoint may have changed — please file an issue. |
| Small dot in the corner | Data is stale (a refresh failed); the numbers shown are the last known good ones. | Usually transient; it clears on the next successful refresh. |

Plugin logs are under `com.singerous.ai-limits.sdPlugin/logs/`. They never contain tokens, but
review before sharing.

## Known limitations

- Built on **unofficial endpoints** — may break if the CLIs change internally.
- Codex token **auto-refresh is not implemented** yet; if the Codex session expires you'll see
  "Login Required" until you re-run the Codex CLI.
- The Copilot key needs a **metered premium-interactions quota** to draw a bar. Plans that report the
  quota as unlimited show **No Data**, with no countdown — there is no percentage to display.
- The plugin pins the Stream Deck **Node 20** runtime (the Node 24 runtime mishandles a header the
  Codex endpoint requires).
